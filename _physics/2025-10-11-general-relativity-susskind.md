The Theoretical Minimum refers to a series of courses on various topics in physics taught by Professor Leonard Susskind at Stanford University over several years. The recordings of these lectures are available at https://theoreticalminimum.com. The aim of the series is to teach all that is necessary to truly understand modern physics—at a much deeper level than popular science books usually offer.

In my opinion, these are ideal courses for people in science and technology—non-physicists such as engineers—who want to go beyond the basic foundations they learned during their undergraduate years. They are also excellent for first- or second-year physics students who wish to gain an early glimpse into advanced physics. People in that position, like myself, do believe that one can hardly learn anything truly meaningful in science without using equations, which are essential for expressing ideas deeply and rigorously. Professor Susskind did an outstanding job with these continuing classes, for which people like myself are deeply grateful. Some of his students later decided to write books based on them. Many had already compiled and published lecture notes, so moving on to write full books seemed a natural next step.

I first read Volumes I, II and III of The Theoretical Minimum a few years ago and had been looking forward to Volume IV, devoted to General Relativity (GR).
General Relativity is a challenging subject, involving lengthy equations (even more so than quantum mechanics) and requiring a solid understanding of differential geometry. There are many excellent textbooks at various levels, but I was unable to find one that struck the right balance—something truly foundational, yet still rigorous in both mathematics and physics. During my current B.S. in Physics, I have already studied Quantum Mechanics and Hilbert spaces, as well as the fundamentals of Classical Field Theory and Special Relativity. Since then, I have often found myself puzzled—as many probably are—by how different gravity seems from other fundamental fields, both in its nature and in our understanding of it (though I might be mistaken, as I am not an expert in the field). It’s remarkable that the electromagnetic field, discovered long after gravity, is so much comprehensively (not sure if this is the right word) understood and explained.

When I finally got my copy of General Relativity: The Theoretical Minimum (Volume IV), I devoted many hours during the summer of 2025 to reading it. To reinforce my understanding, I decided to create my own notes—a kind of summary—to help me both consolidate what I’ve learned and have a quick reference for the main ideas and concepts of GR whenever I need a refresher. The document with the notes can be found in this repository at _physics/2025-10-19-Student Notes on General Relativity.pdf. A quick description of the origin of GR, which to me is the Equivalence Principle, is not in that document of notes. It is explained below.
