The Theoretical Minimum refers to a number of courses on a variety of topics in Physics by Prof. Susskind at Stanford that took place during several years and whose recordings you can find at https://theoreticalminimum.com. They try to teach all that is necessary to understand modern physics in a way much deeper that popular science books. In my opinion, they are the perfect courses for science and technology people, non-physicists, for example engineers, who want to go beyond the foundations they learnt during their college years or for physics students in their first or sencond year of studies who want to get a glimpse about advanced physics. Individuals in that situation, such as me, see you barely can learn something interesting without equations, as a way to deeply and fully express ideas in science. Professor Susskind did a great job during this continuing classes and some of his students decided to write a book with the content of those classes. Some of them already had put together notes and published them. Hence, moving to that next step which is writing a book, seems somehow natural. I first read Volume I, II and III of the Theoretical Minimum a few years ago and was I looking forward to reading Volume IV, devoted to General Relativity.
